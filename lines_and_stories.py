Drawings of her childhood, meeting up to walk after school 
A ripped photo put back together
But it was when she saw the last drawing that her blood ran cold, she ran out Sarah’s house to Jessica house where she to down the street and sprinted upstairs.  She walked into Jessica’s room. Ad there is where she saw her, Jessica laying in bed, with no mouth. It was last drawing she saw in Sarah desk
When Sarah came back with lemonade she panicked. Her drawings were strewn around   and Elizabeth was gone. She knew Elizabeth wouldn’t ever forget her and she couldn’t live with the despair of knowing that her best friend hates her.
Then and there, she ripped up every drawing she painted, erasing every memory of her from Elizabeth mind, and putting Jessica back to normal.
She went to school next day, a stranger to her best friend. Ad she never drew again.
