""" DRAW  
She grabbed an old drawing of two of them and tore it in half
The next day at school when Sarah went to apologize to Elizabeth, Elizabeth didn’t recognize her.
She simply looked at her with a blank stare. Later that day, she noticed Jessica whispering something in Elizabeth ear as though they were talking about her.
She became enrage again
That night she taped the drawing to back together so Elizabeth would remember who she was.  But then, she made another drawing. 
Clearing Jessica was poisoning Elizabeth mind and she had to be stopped 
Jessica came to school next day
Elizabeth remember Sarah again and the 2 meet up in front the school and walk home together once again The hung out like old times Sarah was ecstatic to have her old friend back
But when she went downstairs to get lemonade, Elizabeth discovered Sarah drawings.
As she flipped the draws in Sarah desk, her life flashed before her.
Drawings of her childhood, meeting up to walk after school 
A ripped photo put back together
But it was when she saw the last drawing that her blood ran cold, she ran out Sarah’s house to Jessica house where she to down the street and sprinted upstairs.  She walked into Jessica’s room. Ad there is where she saw her, Jessica laying in bed, with no mouth. It was last drawing she saw in Sarah desk
When Sarah came back with lemonade she panicked. Her drawings were strewn around   and Elizabeth was gone. She knew Elizabeth wouldn’t ever forget her and she couldn’t live with the despair of knowing that her best friend hates her.
Then and there, she ripped up every drawing she painted, erasing every memory of her from Elizabeth mind, and putting Jessica back to normal.
She went to school next day, a stranger to her best friend. Ad she never drew again.

""" KITCHEN But the house was quiet after school now. Chrissie settled in her room and began her homework waiting for her mom to get back home. Her dog sat beside her. Chrissie had just finished her first math problem when she heard the door slam downstairs. Mom must be home early. Chrissie called down to her, “mom”. There was no response. Probably just the wind, she thought. She shrugged it off and continues her homework. An hour past she almost finished her first assignment when she faintly heard the sounds of pots and pans clanging downstairs. She hadn’t heard mom come in the door.
Disembodied voice: chrissyyyy
A voice called from downstairs
One second Chrissie responded, finishing up her final math problem
Disembodied voice: chrissyyyy
The voice called again
Chrissie closed the books and walk downstairs, calling her dog to follow but he wouldn’t budge. She shrugged it off and walked downstairs and into the kitchen
No one was there but what she saw sent a chill down her spine. Every pot and pan in the house had been stacked neatly in the middle of the room. Cabinets lay open and empty.
[She heard the sound of a creaking door]
The side door flew open beside her. In the doorway stood Chrissie’s mom, groceries in hand. But if she was only just getting home, who laid out the pots and pans?  Mom looked around at the scattered pots and pans, confused. “You helping me cook tonight, Chrissie?”
“I didn’t do this” replied Chrissie, as she and her mom looked around the kitchen…
“Then who did?” asked her mom 
Disembodied voice: Chrissyyyyy dinner is ready
